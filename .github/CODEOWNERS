# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line specifies a file pattern followed by one or more code owners.
# Owners can be GitHub usernames (prefixed with @) or team names (@org/team-name).
# Email addresses can also be used in some systems like Bitbucket.

# Default owners for all files in the repository
# This rule has the lowest precedence and applies if no other rule matches.
